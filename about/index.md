Oh hello!, I didn't see you there. I'm Carlos, nice to meet you.

I've been working in the game industry for about 10 years and have had the fortune of developing and shipping a lot of games (some with more success than others).
I love seeing what other people use for their life and ideas.

In the vein of How do they work and UsesThis I'm sharing my tools and tricks of the trade.
