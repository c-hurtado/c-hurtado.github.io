Oh hello!, I didn't see you there. I'm **Carlos**, nice to meet you.
<br/><br/>As you see, I've been building stuff since I was a kid.

I'm born in Chile and moved to the United States to pursue a career in Entertainment Technology. I'm now a citizen and I've been in the industry since 2008.
I'm passionate about making video games and more recently about being in leadership to mentor and manage engineers, supporting them in their career and accelerating the process of making video games to spend that time in fun and quality.

My last job was as a  **Technical Lead Manager** at [Sanzaru Games (a Meta studio)](http://www.sanzarugames.com) where I've shipped several award winning VR Titles including  [Asgard's Wrath](https://www.carloshurtado.com/gameDevProjects/AsgardsWrath/) and  [Asgard's Wrath 2](https://www.carloshurtado.com/gameDevProjects/AsgardsWrath2/) for the Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest 2/3 respectively.

I live in San Mateo, in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife and kid.

### Education


I have a [Master of Entertainment Technology](https://etc.cmu.edu) degree from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) , and an engineering and a bachelor degree in CS from [Universidad de Chile](http://www.uchile.cl). Since graduating from my master I've worked at [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com), [Bigpoint](http://www.bigpoint.com) and most recently [Sanzaru Games](http://www.sanzaru.com) which was acquired by Meta in 2020 and later shut down in 2026.

You can read more about the specific projects I worked on in the [Game Development]({{site.url}}/gamedev) page.
