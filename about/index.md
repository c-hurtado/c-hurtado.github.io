Oh hello!, I didn't see you there. I'm *Carlos*, nice to meet you.

Let's start by saying that this page is about me, my site and my interests.

 If you are into tech, productivity, entertainment, games, gadgets and experiences, you are in the right place!
I'm always consuming content, media, and articles and there is much I want to share with audiences.
Also, this site is a game / puzzle. You have to navigate it to unlock its contents... Don't worry, the most important stuff is unlocked, but you can get some of the fun/funny parts with the unlocks.


This is like my ninth version of a personal webpage, but I am quite happy with this one, both because it represents me as a game developer and also as an artist.
On that note, professionally I'm currently a Lead Engineer at [Sanzaru Games](http://www.sanzarugames.com).
We released [Asgard's Wrath](https://www.carloshurtado.com/asgardwrath/), which was nominated to Several Awards.

### Professional Life
I've been working in the game industry for about 10 years. I have a Master of Entertainment Degree from Carnegie Mellon University , and an engineering and a bachelor degree in CS from Universidad de Chile. Since graduating from my master I've worked at Electronic Arts, Bigpoint and most recently Sanzaru Games.
I've been fortunate to have developed and released about 9 titles both for PC, Mobile platforms and Virtual Reality.

You can read more about the specific projects I worked on in the [Game Development]({{site.url}}/gamedev) page.
