# Carlos Hurtado Website
-------
This is my [personal site](https://www.carloshurtado.com). It includes a bunch of javascript and cookies to make a game out of investigating the site, and also for the synthwave style.

I used [Git Hub Pages](https://www.github.com) with jekyll. I started the theme based on **[Moon](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon)**  theme. Modded the hell out of it.
