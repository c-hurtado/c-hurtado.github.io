In the vein of [How I Work](https://lifehacker.com/c/how-i-work) and [UsesThis](https://usesthis.com/) I'm sharing my tools and tricks of the trade. From web tools, to iPad Tools and more. I customize, jailbreak, and try a lot of things.
These apps here are my hidden gems...

## Web tools
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), a great site to generate projects and organize ideas. Mixes concepts of [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com) with [Trello](https://www.trello.com), and allows you to sort the same data in multiple ways.
* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), my RSS reader by default after Google Reader went extinct. I basically spend most of my time in this site.
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), is my media sharing tool. I use it on my phone, ipad and PC to share the art I create on Procreate in the ipad.

## Cross-Platform Software
* [Adobe Photoshop](http://adobe.com). I used to use photoshop for digital art, but now I'm using it more for photo manipulation.
* [Adobe Lightroom Classic](http://adobe.com). As I've traveled with my wife, I have been doing photography and collecting pictures. This software allows me to do two things:
  * Color correction
  * Book Creation: Using the Book service Blurb (integrated w)

## Windows Software
* [FalconX](https://chrisandriessen.nl/web/FalconX.html) This app allows to put the taskbar icons in the middle for a cooler look.

## Mac OS X Software
* [Oversight](https://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html) For people that care about being hacked, oversight monitors audio and video sessions and lets you know when the microphone or the camera got activated
* [Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/) This cool tool allows you to manage your windows by using the touchpad.


## IOS Software
* [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) I use this as my main Todo app. I have both the iphone and Ipad version and they are synced.
* [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) This is my calendar app of choice. Use it mostly on my Iphone. It has great text understanding so that it creates the event with the most information possible.
* [Pandora](https://www.pandora.com/) Music app of choice. I have a subscription I share with my wife. I don't have time to pick songs but I have my good thumbnail station
* [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/) A new finding for me, but I've been using it non-stop since I found it, it allows you to borrow digital books from a local library both in written and audio form. I rent (for free) a bunch of audio books.
* [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) My current podcast app. Love the configuration values to go back specific amounts and go forward specific amounts. 
* [Outlook](https://apps.apple.com/dz/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596) I use this one as my main mail app. Somehow works better than gmail and allows me to access my personal and work email.
* [Masterclass](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/masterclass-learn-new-skills/id1273867416) App for the Masterclass website, which allows me to get instructions from several masters of many topics. 
* [Procreate 5](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/procreate/id425073498) My art tool of choice on my iPad PRO. The best out there (and I've tried a bunch).

## Jailbreak Tweaks
* **Accent** Gives IOS accent colors in the different menus
* **Aporeo** Whenever I plug my phone to a power source, it sends me to low battery mode so it charges faster.
* **Canvas** Allows me to change the background on my CarPlay in my car.
* **ColorMeNotifs** Allows to change the color of the notification so they match the icons.
* **FloatingDockPlus13** Lots of improvements to the dock (max number of icons, and ipad like behavior)
* **Lyricify** Adds a find lyrics button on any song! I love singing.
* **MilkyWay2** Adds multitasking to IOS (windows!)
* **Pastel** Adds icon-based or custom color to notifications
* **Snowboard** The tweak that allows to change your icons or fonts.
