In the vein of [How I Work](https://lifehacker.com/c/how-i-work) and [UsesThis](https://usesthis.com/) I'm sharing my tools and tricks of the trade. From web tools, to iPad Tools and more. I customize, jailbreak, and try a lot of things.

## Web tools
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), a great site to generate projects and organize ideas. Mixes concepts of [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com) with [Trello](https://www.trello.com), and allows you to sort the same data in multiple ways.
* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), my RSS reader by default after Google Reader went extinct. I basically spend most of my time in this site.
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), is my media sharing tool. I use it on my phone, ipad and PC to share the art I create on Procreate in the ipad.

## Cross-Platform Software
* [Adobe Photoshop](http://adobe.com). I used to use photoshop for digital art, but now I'm using it more for photo manipulation.
* [Adobe Lightroom Classic](http://adobe.com). As I've traveled with my wife, I have been doing photography and collecting pictures. This software allows me to do two things:
  * Color correction
  * Book Creation: Using the Book service Blurb (integrated w)

## Windows Software
* [FalconX](https://chrisandriessen.nl/web/FalconX.html) This app allows to put the taskbar icons in the middle for a cooler look.

## Mac OS X Software
* [Oversight](https://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html) For people that care about being hacked, oversight monitors audio and video sessions and lets you know when the microphone or the camera got activated
* [Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/) This cool tool allows you to manage your windows by using the touchpad.


## IPhone Software


## IPad Software
