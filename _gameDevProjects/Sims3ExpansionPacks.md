At [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com) I was a gameplay engineer for the Maxis Studios. As a first job out of grad-school I worked and published 3 expansion packs and multiple stuff packs. Each expansion pack was on a 6 month development cycle.
I worked on Sims 3: Late Night, Sims 3: Generations and Sims 3: Pets.
