I started at Sanzaru (developers of Sly Cooper 4) as part as the very small mobile group. Just in a team of 2 engineers we developed a Casual Hidden Object game for the publisher Big Fish Games.

The project was a cross-platform PC and IOS game. We worked with a custom engine from Sanzaru. I also worked on developing customer service websites to allow for tracking and modifications to tuning while the game was live.
