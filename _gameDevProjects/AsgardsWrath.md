I was one of the two lead engineers in this project. It's a 30+ hour VR Action RPG designed from the ground up for VR. Published by Oculus, this game got nominated for best VR game of the year by multiple outlets.
It was chosen by Forbes as Best VR game of the year.

It was developed in Unreal Engine and C++ and I led a team of 9 engineers as well as making some systems.
