I was one of the two lead engineers in this project. It's a 30+ hour VR Action RPG designed from the ground up for VR. Published by Oculus, this game got nominated for best VR game of the year by multiple outlets including DICE and The Game Awards. I joined late in the project as I was leading Marvel Powers United VR.

DICE Awards (2020): Nominated for Immersive Reality Game of the Year & Technical Achievement.
NAVGTR Awards (2020): Nominated for Control Design, VR & Sound Mixing in VR.
IGN: Won People's Choice Awards for Best VR Game & PC Exclusive Game. 

Asgard's Wrath was chosen by Forbes as Best VR game of the year.

It was developed in Unreal Engine and C++ and I led a team of 9 engineers as well as making some systems.
